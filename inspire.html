    <h2><b>What do you need to inspire someone?</b></h2>
    <p>To be able to inspire someone it takes many things or even a few. To have trust in each other, Being yourself, Creating a motivating environment.</p>
    <p> Personally, I believe to inspire someone you need to be able to find something similar between each other. Enough that it makes you want to push yourself to be better or more.</p>
